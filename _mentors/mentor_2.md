Iâ€™m a geologist/physicist/data scientist at the CSIRO. I work on a range of science projects across the organisation, generally using geoscience and geospatial data with machine learning and data analysis to improve exploration and production strategies for the minerals and mets sector. As well as science-y things, you can ask me about webservices, maps and geospatial data. Python is my poison of choice.
